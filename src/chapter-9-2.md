* Pause and hold your breath for a count of four, visualizing drawing the final side of the box.
* Repeat this cycle several times, focusing on the breath and the visualization of the box.

2. Body Scan Meditation
-----------------------

Body scan meditation cultivates awareness of physical sensations and emotions, promoting emotional regulation. Follow these steps:

* Find a comfortable lying or seated position.
* Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths to center yourself.
* Begin by bringing your attention to the sensations in your toes and slowly move your focus up through your body, paying attention to each area.
* As you scan each body part, notice any sensations or emotions that arise without judgment or attachment.
* If you encounter tension or discomfort, direct your breath to that area and imagine releasing it with each exhale.

3. Loving-kindness Meditation
-----------------------------

Loving-kindness meditation fosters compassion and positive emotions towards oneself and others. Follow these steps:

* Sit comfortably and bring your attention to your breath.
* Silently repeat phrases such as "May I be happy, May I be peaceful" or "May all beings be happy, May all beings be peaceful."
* As you recite the phrases, visualize sending love, kindness, and well-wishes to yourself, loved ones, neutral individuals, and even difficult people.
* If distracting thoughts arise, gently return your focus to the phrases and the sensations of your breath.

4. Breath Counting
------------------

Breath counting is a technique that helps enhance concentration and regulate emotions. Follow these steps:

* Sit in a comfortable position and close your eyes.
* Take a few deep breaths to settle in.
* Begin counting each inhalation and exhalation, starting from one and going up to ten.
* Once you reach ten, start over again from one.
* If you become distracted or lose count, simply acknowledge it without judgment and return to one.

5. Mindful Walking
------------------

Mindful walking combines the benefits of physical movement and mindful breathing. Follow these steps:

* Find a quiet outdoor space or walk in a designated area indoors.
* Walk at a natural pace, focusing your attention on the physical sensations of walking.
* Sync your breath with your steps. For example, inhale for three steps, exhale for three steps.
